# ImageMultiselect 1.0 Plugin

This plugin provides your a component to select images in you website. You will
have two sets of images (left and right). In the left side you will find all 
available images (pagination is working). In the right panel you will see 
selected images. User can choose an image by clicking it and add/remove it
by double click. Additionally, there are 4 well known buttons: add one item, add
all items, remove one item, remove all items. Developer can customize the view
through css.

The plugin is based on the MeioUpload Behavior. You should consider its README
and installation notes. http://github.com/jrbasso/MeioUpload
